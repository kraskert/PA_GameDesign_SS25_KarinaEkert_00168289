## Overview

microNAUTS: Cellular Crisis is a short educational game that revisits and reinforces biology class material about the structure and function of an animal cell.

The story follows a slightly chaotic scientific experiment:  
A mad scientist convinces the player to drink a strange serum that shrinks them to microscopic size — and then swallows them. The player ends up inside the scientist’s body and must help restore his cell functions before escaping.

## Features

- 3 fully playable educational levels
- Illustrated fun and chaotic mini-narrative with a scientific twist through the intro and outro scene

## Gameplay

The game consists of 3 interactive levels and two narrative sequences (intro and finale):

- **Intro Scene**  
  Click anywhere to progress through panels and learn the backstory.

- **Level 1: Restore the Cell**  
  Drag and drop the correct organelles into their correct places in the cell.

- **Level 2: Fix the Nucleus**  
  A cracked nucleus must be repaired by clicking on the correct helper items.

- **Level 3: Defend Against Viruses**  
  Click on fast-moving viruses to destroy them before they destroy the cell.

- **Final Scene**  
  Similar to the intro, clicking progresses through a narrative ending sequence.  
  After sneezing, the scientist restores his original health — and the player returns to full size.
